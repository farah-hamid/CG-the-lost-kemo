# The Lost Kemo

## User Manual 

initially, the home page screen will be displayed to the user, where he will have two options:

1- read the story as printed text on the print screen

2- watch the story as an animated presentation

when he chooses the first option, the story is displayed to him in print, and he can then return 
to the same main page to choose the second option, which is to watch the graphic story.

The story is presented according to the scenes drawn (14 scenes), so that each scene takes 10 
seconds, then moves to the next scene, and so on until all the scenes are finished

In this project we use texture to one of the scenes of the story which is scene 13 so if you 
want to use our code you should download the picture in bmp extension in your device and according 
to your operating system if you have :
1]Save the image(. bmp) to your device

3] change the path for the picture - line 136
4]

            , and remove the comment from the line for the Mac system.
